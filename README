!!!!!!!! use Xtext 2.0 now.

So far, I am not so sure what to commit. The whole Java workspace or just the file for grammar? At this stage, I choose to only submit the grammar file. The following is the steps to build the project in eclipse for the ATS IDE.

First of all, please have some basic knowledge about Xtext. Please at least read the chap 2 of the following toturial: <<http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/1_0_1/xtext.pdf>> so that you can have certain clue of what I am referring to.

Step 01: install Xtext
  AS an eclipse plugin, there are many ways to install Xtext. The simplest way is to download a completely new eclipse with Xtext already installed in it. Please refer to the description of "A Complete Distribution" on http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/download/

Step 02: create an Xtext project. (Please refer to the chap2 of the toturial.)
  You can choose the name of the project as well as the name of your language. (And you may need to modify the name as well as the content of the file "AtsLang.xtext" in this repository accordingly.) My configuration for the project creation goes as follows:
============================================
  Project name: org.ats_lang.ide.iats
  Language
    Name: org.ats_lang.Anairiats
    Extensions: sats, dats
============================================

Stop 03: Replace the autogenerated file "org.xtext.example.atside\src\org\xtext\example\atside\AtsLang.xtext" with the corresponding file in this repository.

Step 04: modify the mwe2 file (GenerateAtsLang.mwe2) (No need to do this for Xtext 2.0)
  The reason for doing this is to accommodate both sats and dats files using one grammar. According to the Eclipse forum (http://www.eclipse.org/forums/), it should be done when we specify Extensions to be "sats, dats" during project creation. But it turns out that this doesn't work. So we have to modify the GenerateAtsLang.mwe2 file, change 
======================
var file.extensions = "sats"
======================
to
======================
var file.extensions = "sats, dats"
======================

Step 05: 
  Right click on "GenerateAtsLang.mwe2" -> "Run as" -> "MWE2 Workflow"
  Right click on the project -> "Run as" -> "Eclipse Application"
